# Parameter Counter ðŸ§®
 
This project is a Java application that receives two numerical parameters from the user and counts the numbers between them. If the first parameter is greater than the second, a custom exception (ParametrosInvalidosException) is thrown, informing the user that the second parameter must be greater than the first.

## Features
- Receives two numbers as input.
- Counts and prints the numbers between the first and second parameter.
- Throws a custom exception if the second parameter is smaller than the first.

## Technologies Used
- Java 8 or higher: Programming language.
- Custom Exception: Uses a custom exception class (ParametrosInvalidosException).
- Scanner: For reading input from the terminal.
